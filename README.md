# üß≠ certfwd

**certfwd** is a lightweight, standalone reverse proxy tool for forwarding SOAP/TLS requests with injected client certificates and path-aware forwarding. Ideal for cases where the client cannot natively handle certificates appropriately, or where you want full visibility and control over secure traffic.

Designed to work equally well on Windows and Linux, without dependencies.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
certfwd <localUrl> <targetUrl> <certSubject> [--preserve-encoding] [--log-body=false]
```

### Arguments

| Argument            | Description                                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `localUrl`          | Local URL to listen on, e.g. `http://localhost:5000/`              |
| `targetUrl`         | Remote URL to forward requests to, e.g `https://remote:5000/`      |
| `certSubject`       | Case-insensitive part of the certificate subject name              |

### Options

| Option                  | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--preserve-encoding`   | Preserve the original client request encoding when forwarding     |
| `--log-body=false`      | Disable body content logging (headers and metadata remain visible)|

## üîê Certificate Handling

### Windows
Uses certificates from X.509 `CurrentUser` and `LocalMachine` stores. Manage them using `certmgr.msc`.

### Linux
Place `.pfx` files into:
```
~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my/
```
This simulates the `X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser)` path for .NET.

---

## üìÅ Logging

certfwd writes logs to a file in addition to the terminal.

| Platform   | Log File Path                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows    | `%LocalAppData%\certfwd\proxy.log`                    |
| Linux/macOS| `~/.local/share/certfwd/proxy.log`                    |

The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

---

## üõ† Building

To build a fully self-contained binary with trimming and AOT (Requires installed tooling for C/C++):

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 \
  -p:PublishTrimmed=true \
  -p:PublishAot=true
```

Replace `win-x64` with `linux-x64` to build for Linux.
